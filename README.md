# README: ChatGPT Usage Analysis Project

## Project Title: **Understanding My ChatGPT Usage Patterns and Learning Evolution**

### **Project Overview**
This project analyzes my interactions with ChatGPT to understand how I use it for learning, problem-solving, and advice. By categorizing my interactions, I aim to track my learning journey and progression as a computer science student.

### **Motivation**
The project aims to:
- **Understand my learning habits** by analyzing interactions with ChatGPT.
- Create a **data science portfolio** to demonstrate proficiency in data collection, machine learning, and data visualization, reflecting my learning journey.

### **Project Objectives**
1. **Categorize Interactions**: Classify conversations by purpose (e.g., learning, debugging, career advice).
2. **Analyze Trends**: Track changes in usage and learning focus over time.
3. **Visualize Insights**: Use data visualization to illustrate my learning evolution.

### **Data Source**
The data will come from my ChatGPT usage logs, including timestamps and conversation details. Data will be collected via API and manual exports, ensuring anonymization for privacy.

### **Techniques Used**
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Collect data from logs using API integration and organize it for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explore dataset features like common topics and interaction frequency.
3. **Data Visualization**: Use matplotlib and seaborn for trend and pattern visualizations.
4. **Hypothesis Testing**: Test hypotheses about usage patterns, like increased activity before exams.
5. **Machine Learning**: Use classification models for supervised learning and clustering for unsupervised insights.
6. **Text Analysis**: Apply NLP for topic modeling to categorize conversation themes.
7. **Causal Inference**: Attempt to infer relationships between interaction types and performance.

### **Analysis & Findings**
- **Interaction Categories**: Classify conversations into "Learning," "Debugging," and "Career Guidance." Initial interactions are expected to focus on learning, shifting to more problem-solving over time.
- **Learning Evolution**: Expect a shift from broad topics to more specialized questions.
- **Emotional Tone**: Apply sentiment analysis to determine emotional trends, with positive sentiment for learning topics and negative for debugging.

### **Technologies and Tools Used**
- **Python**: For data analysis and machine learning.
- **Pandas, NumPy**: For data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**: For visualizations.
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning models.
- **NLTK/TextBlob**: For sentiment analysis.

### **Limitations and Future Work**
- **Limitations**: The dataset is limited to personal usage and may not represent others. Sentiment analysis may be imperfect due to text nuances.
- **Future Work**: Collect more data for long-term analysis and explore advanced NLP techniques for deeper insights.
